title: Online Ticket Selling

purpose: iNDIEVOX is the largest platform for indie bands promotion in Taiwan. The service contains online tickets selling for concerts and music events.

description: I am responsible for server monitoring during large ticket selling events. Unlike ticket selling services in Japan which allow users to register previously and then randomly being chosen, the service needs to handle large access and complete the selling process during short period.
